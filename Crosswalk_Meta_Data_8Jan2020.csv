Column,Description
study,HCPA or HCPD (HCPA includes HCD Parents who are also HCA participants - use HCA ID - see pedid number in ndar_subjects for family groups)
Inst,where applicable: NIH Toolbox Instrument Name - e.g. the contents of 'Inst'
dbase,"name of redcap database or BOX file id # containing source data - note that for box #s pointing to snapshots, the current snapshot may have changed…see Petra or Moises for more info what is functioning as a 'database' in Box for these measures...meanwhile, please confirm with them that the ids are current"
hcp_variable,"Name of the Variable being mapped, as it exists in HCP data ready for crossing over - note that for NIH Toolbox Data, HCP Variables are not ready until spaces and special characters have been replaced with underscores.  So even though they come off the IPad with such things, they are listed without in this crosswalk"
variable_label,label of the HCP variable being mapped
variable_type,"taking REDCap's lead here - radio, text, checkbox, int, num, etc."
variable_options,taking REDCap's lead here - values encoding radio/checkbox options
nda_structure,"NDA Structure (group of variables…they are trying to organize vars by published instruments, and then into domains…not really working well for them, but whatever) to which our data is mapped"
nda_element,NDA Element (i.e. a variable) to which our data is mapped
structure_label,Label of the NDA structure to which our data is mapped
element_label,Label of the element 
element_description,More element context
element_values,"In cases where variables contain categorical information, values encode categories.  "
inst_short,where applicable: NDAs shorthand for NIH Toolbox Instrument  - this is NOT NDAs name for any particular structure -  it is merely used in crossover mapping
template,name of NDA template provided by Leo for crossover mapping
action_request,"Requests that NDA made of CCF to avoid naming conflicts, or value codings, etc. "
hcp_variable_upload,"HCP Variable name in uploaded file (usually the same as HCP_Variable because NDA took care of adding HCP variables as aliases to NDA_Element (don't bother looking for them - they're hidden in XML code behind the scenes in D.C.), but some cases required renames to avoid database conflict"
requested_python,"Python code to handle Form Requests, unless specialty code required"
specialty_code,"Indicator variable for whether form request requires code that cant be handled with a handful of Python statements in the requested_python column.  >=0 means solution required special consideration in crosswalk.py.  For example, drug/alcohol/nicotine sessions needed to be split and stacked as repeated measures of the same variable...this was different (special) than the bulk of the data being reformatted for NDA.  Likewise, in some cases, there needed to be a merge of 3 different RedCap databases (more common in HCPD) with differet python transformations for each of them, prior to crosswalking. "
